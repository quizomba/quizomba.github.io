This is my attempt to create a visualization to investigate a corelation between women's rights and how homosexuality is accept.
In order to do that, I crossed 15 variables, both from World Value Survey and Gapminder.

#Visualization Features#
Brushing: it is possible to brush selections.
Reordering: by clicking in the variable name, it is possible to reorder the axis.
Inverting: double-clicking the variable name will reorder the axis.


#Imporant facts#
Every data has been normalized, in order to fit the scale best. That's why some numbers are negative.
The data is incomplete. When a country lacks data for a variable, it is 0.
Some waves/time periods do not contain some variables. In those cases, the variable has been deleted.



Key to Variables:

V40: Homosexuals accepted as  neighbors.
The higher the scale, more accepted homosexuals are.

V45: Men have a priority in scarce job market.
The higher the number, higher men's priority.

V47: Women with higher salary mean a problem with her husband.
The higher the number, more problematic it is.

V48: Having a job is good to make a woman independent.
Higher the number, best is for a woman to have a job.

V51: Men make better political decision than woman.
Higher the number, better men are at political decisions.

V53: Men make better executives than woman.
Higher the number, better executives men are.

V139: Women participation is crucial for democracy.
Higher the number, more people agree.

V203: Homosexuality is always justifiable.
Higher the number, more people agree with this.
