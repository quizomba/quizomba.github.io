      <h2>Trying to help you visualize the intersection between homosexuality acceptance and women's rights.</h2>

    <div class="intro">
      
      This is my attempt to create a visualization to investigate a corelation between women's rights and how homosexuality is accept.
      In order to do that, I crossed 15 variables, both from World Value Survey and Gapminder. </h1>

      <br>
      <strong> #Visualization Features# </strong>
      <br>Brushing: it is possible to brush selections.
      <br>Reordering: by clicking in the variable name, it is possible to reorder the axis.
      <br>Inverting: double-clicking the variable name will reorder the axis.
      <br> Responsive Grid: when brushing, the table will update according to selection.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>#Good to Know#</strong>
      <br>
      Every data has been normalized, in order to fit the scale best. That's why some numbers are negative.
      The data is incomplete. When a country lacks data for a variable, it is 0.
      Some waves/time periods do not contain some variables. In those cases, the variable has been deleted.
