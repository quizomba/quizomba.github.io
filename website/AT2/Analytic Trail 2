 Analytic Trail 2
How does women's right relate to acceptance of homosexuality?
In this project I will investigate how homosexuals acceptance and womenâ€™s right interact in a society. In order to do that, I crossed 8 variables avaiable in the World Value Survey database. I cleaned and treated the data, finding quotients, so I had one unique number to compare each country. I also normalized the quotients, so the scale in each different variable is more relatable. Here it's possible to see each variable and what the data is telling.
Here the datasets are different, as the analytic tool. I used d3 and also added Gapminder data. 



Years in schoo

	<li> <strong> Years in School (YS) </strong> <br>
	The average number of years of school attended by all women between 15 and 44. I made an average of the years in the periods.
	<br> <br>

	<li> <strong> Suicide Among Women (SW) </strong> <br>
	Mortality due to self-inflicted injury among women, per 100 000 standard population. I made an average of the years in the periods.
	<br> <br>

	<li> <strong> Ratio of young literate females to males (LW) </strong> <br>
	Ratio of young literate females to males is the percentage of females to males ages 15-24 who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. I made an average of the years in the periods.
	<br> <br>	

	<li> <strong> Murdered women (MW) </strong> <br>
	Mortality among women due to inter-personal violence, per 100 000 standard population. I made an average of the years in the periods.
	<br> <br>	

	<li> <strong> Contraceptive Methods (CM) </strong> <br>
	 The percentage of women who are practicing, or whose sexual partners are practicing, any form of contraception. It is usually measured for married women ages 15-49 only. I made an average of the years in the periods.
	<br> <br>	

	<li> <strong> Ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education (%) (GBR) </strong> <br>
	Average between the avaiable years in the periods.
