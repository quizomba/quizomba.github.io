	<h1> Analytic Trail 1 </h1>
	<h1> How does women's right relate to acceptance of homosexuality? </h1>

	<h2> In this project I will investigate how homosexuals acceptance and women’s right interact in a society. In order to do that,  I crossed 8 variables avaiable in the World Value Survey database. I cleaned and treated the data, finding  quotients, so I had one unique number to compare each country. I also normalized the quotients, so the scale in each different variable is more relatable.  Here it's possible to see each variable and what the data is telling. </h2>


<div class="quo" >	

	<li> <strong>  V45 When jobs are scarce, men have a priority. </strong> <br>
	Number of people who agree/number of people who disagree. Bigger numbers mean men have a higher priority.
	<br>
	<br>

	<li> <strong>v47 There is a problem in women earning more than men </strong> <br>
	Number of people who agree/number of people who disagree. Bigger numbers mean women with higher salaries can be a problem.
	<br>
	<br>


	<li><strong>V51 Men make better decision than women politically </strong> <br>
	Number of people who agree/number of people who disagree. Bigger numbers mean men make better decisions.
	<br>
	<br>

	<li><strong>V53 Men make better business executive than woman </strong> <br>
	Number of people who agree/number of people who disagree. Bigger numbers mean men make better executives.
	<br>
	<br>

	<li><strong>V139 Democracy: women have the same right as men </strong> <br>
	% of people who said women participation is crucial for a country democracy.
	<br>
	<br>

	<li><strong>V48 Having a job is the best way for a woman to be independent </strong> <br>
	Number of people who agree/number of people who disagree. Bigger numbers mean having job is more relevant for a woman.
	<br>
	<br>

	<li><strong>V40 Would not like to have as neighbors homosexuals </strong> <br>
	Number of people who mentioned homosexuals are not good neighbors/number of people who did not mentioned. Bigger numbers mean homosexuality is more accepted.
	<br>
	<br>

	<li><strong>V203 Justifiable: homosexuality </strong> <br>
	The mean answer, nn a scale where 0 means homosexuality is never justifiable and 10 means it’s always justifiable.

 Although the number of countries can make it a little complicated, we can see that there are big variations between the variables. We can find some negative correlations. For example, countries with a higher V40 number (meaning they accept more homosexuals) tend to have a lower v45 number (which means they don't think men have priority in a scarce job market). In other words, we can say that countries tend to be more "progressive" as a hole, that is: if they accept homosexuality, women tend to be more equal as men. It can be that both variables are a measure of "macho" traits in a society, but this needs further investigaion.

<h2> With this smaller dataset we can see that there is indeed a correlation. The countries curves are almost inverted, showing that the ones that better accept homosexuality are also the ones where women are more equal to men. </h2>
