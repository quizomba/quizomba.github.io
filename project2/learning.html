      To me, this project was a crazy journey. <strong>I am no programmer</strong>. My coding knowledge is limited to a month-old Codecademy account. So figuring out how to make things work and change what I wanted to change was quite a challenge. Also, <strong> I am not a math-head</strong>. I did take some stats classes back in my Bachelor, but it was more than 5 years ago. Cleaning data was also interesting because of data. 

      Anyway, I am proud of what you see here. This is certainly not the most beautiful, or crafty visualization (there are great people in our class). But still: <strong>I did it myself, relying on Google, RedBull, and long nights. </strong>. And I learnt a lot while doing it.

      <ul>

      <li> <strong> D3.js </strong> <br>
      This was my first take on D3.js. It was not easy, but no doubt now I know way more than a couple of weeks ago. I feel I can really do some things on my own.
      <br> <br>

      <li> <strong> Time Scale </strong> <br>
      There is a bunch of features I wish my visualization had. For example, it would be way better if my visualization had a time scale, with which the user could slide to see changes overtime. I was not able to figure this out, so creating different html with different data was the best option I manage. Not even close to the best possibility. 
      <br> <br>
      
      <li> <strong> CSS+HTML </strong> <br>
      Aside from playing around on FrontPage in Windows95, I had tried designed a website. To make this work, I learnt a considerable amount of CSS and HTML. If this page looks awful is because my configs probably are badly-structured. I am 120% my code is super messy. 
      <br> <br>

      <li> <strong> Data Treatment </strong> <br>
      Dealing with data was complicated. I am not quite sure I did things the right way. I should have invested more time here.
      <br> <br>

      <li> <strong> Exploring the Database </strong> <br>
      I should have played more with the data before starting the project. Figure out what variables were most interesting, which had more countries, how did they were collected. This would led me to a more interesting hypothesis.
      <br> <br>

      <li> <strong> World Mapping is Hard </strong> <br>
      One of my ideas was to have a global map, to situate the user better. I tried a lot of different approaches, but could not manage to make this work. This is a weakness in the project.
      <br> <br>

      <li> <strong> Time Managment </strong> <br>
      I postponed this project more than I should. I should have started it earlier. This would have given me more time to explore databases, look for help with implementations, and make things prettier.
