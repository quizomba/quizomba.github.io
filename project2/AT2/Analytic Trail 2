 Analytic Trail 2
How does women's right relate to acceptance of homosexuality?
In this project I will investigate how homosexuals acceptance and womenâ€™s right interact in a society. In order to do that, I crossed 8 variables avaiable in the World Value Survey database. I cleaned and treated the data, finding quotients, so I had one unique number to compare each country. I also normalized the quotients, so the scale in each different variable is more relatable. Here it's possible to see each variable and what the data is telling.
Here the datasets are different, as the analytic tool. I used d3 and also added Gapminder data. 



Years in schoo

	<li> <strong> Years in School (YS) </strong> <br>

	Ratio of young literate females to males is the percentage of females to males ages 15-24 who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. I made an average of the years in the periods.
